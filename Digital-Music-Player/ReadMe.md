## About The Project

Listening to music is a universally cherished activity, offering relaxation and enjoyment to people from all walks of life. However, musical tastes can vary greatly among individuals, drawing from diverse sources like Spotify, SoundCloud, and traditional radio.

This project aspires to bring this musical diversity to life through a simple and interactive full-stack application. Its goal is to provide users with a platform to explore a wide spectrum of music genres and empower them to curate playlists filled with their favorite tunes.

Key features of this project include:

1. User Accounts: Users can create accounts, enabling them to preserve their preferences, playlists, and progress over time to enhance their overall experience.

2. Playlist Creation: The application allows users to craft custom playlists, serving as virtual collections of their most cherished songs, encouraging the creation of diverse and unique playlists.

3. Interactive Music Control: Users have the ability to interact with the music they're playing. They can play, pause, skip to the previous or next track, adjust playback timestamps, and control the volume. 

4. Keyword Search: Users can easily discover new music or locate specific tracks through a keyword search feature. The application fetches and displays results based on user input.

5. User-Friendly Interface: Designed the project with user convenience in mind, ensuring that multiple pathways lead to the same desired outcomes.
